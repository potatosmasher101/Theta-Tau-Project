# Theta-Tau-Project
Theta Tau Hell Week project!!

Every project must have a GitHub repository.
Your README must include:
1. What the project does
   The project uses an API key to find the users entered city to collect weather data and return it to the main HTML file and display the weather in that city
3. How to run it
   To run the project, you could run it through visual studio code into a search engine and/or into a separate app
5. What tools you used
   I used ChatGPT and gemini and youtube to help get code for the HTML File. I used visual studio code and I also used OpenWeatherAPI to get an API that could be used for the application of the website for it to work
7. Screenshots

9.  A one-sentence “what I learned”
    I learned how to enable the use of an API and how to implement it into a website, I can also use this knowledge for any future projects and/or skills I want to retain
